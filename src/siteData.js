            After building my coding knowledge in Python, 
            I started to learn JavaScript, to which I adapted quickly. 
            I have practiced my JavaScript skills in many different 
            projects, where I used both vanilla JavaScript and a number
            of different libraries. I focus on writing clean and readable code, 
            creating reusable code as much as possible.

            I focus on creating well-structured HTML pages with sensible CSS styling. 
            I love to see a plain HTML page come to life through CSS. In CSS, 
            I use classes to my advantage to create reusable and well-structured
            code.  I also always ensure that the web page is responsive, so users
            of any screen type can use it seamlessly.

            practicing the basics of React and I've been enjoying the speed and 
            simplicity of building web pages in React. I'm excited to learn more
            about this framework so I can use it to create well-structured and 
            well-performing web pages.

    `
        Originally a 3D game artist, I transitioned into the field of front-end
        development because I was looking for a bigger challenge. While finishing 
        my bachelor's degree in 3D visual art, I found an interest in visual 
        scripting and decided to pursue this interest in a master in computer science,
        with a focus on Game and Media Technology. However, at this point I hardly had
        any coding skills and needed to teach myself in order to keep up with my peers,
        which I managed to do successfully. During my master, I realized that
        front-end development was the perfect combination of both my artistic and 
        technical interests. Therefore, I decided to pursue a career as a front-end 
        developer.
    `,
    `
        To achieve this, I have learned the basics of front-end development through 
        Scrimba's Front-End Career path, which I have followed simultaneously with
        my master's degree. During this career path, I have completed a large number
        of projects, a selection of which can be found on this site.
